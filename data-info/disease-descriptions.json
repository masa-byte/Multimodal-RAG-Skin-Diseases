    "cellulitis": "Cellulitis is a common, potentially serious bacterial skin infection that appears as a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot and tender to the touch. It most commonly affects the skin on the lower legs but can occur anywhere on the body, like face, arms, hands, and fingers. Symptoms include redness, swelling, warmth, pain or tenderness, discoloration, blisters or skin dimpling, fever and chills, and swollen lymph nodes near the affected area. The condition is usually caused by bacteria, most commonly Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, entering the body through a break in the skin such as a cut, scrape, insect bite, or surgical wound. Factors increasing the risk of cellulitis include a weakened immune system, chronic skin conditions like eczema or athlete's foot, diabetes, obesity, poor circulation or lymphedema, recent surgery or injury, and intravenous drug use. When you first get cellulitis, your skin looks slightly discolored. It may feel slightly warm to the touch. As the infection spreads, the discoloration gets darker as your skin swells and becomes tender. Treatment typically involves antibiotics to clear the infection and reduce the risk of complications. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for intravenous antibiotics and monitoring.",

    "impetigo": "Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection that commonly affects infants and young children, but can also occur in adults. It typically presents as red sores and blisters on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, and on hairline, scalp, legs and arms. These sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts. Symptoms include red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellow-brown crust, itching and soreness, rash. Impetigo is caused by bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and sometimes Group A Streptococcus, entering the skin through minor cuts, insect bites, or other injuries. Risk factors include being a young age, participating in close-contact activities, warm and humid weather, having broken skin from other conditions like eczema or poison ivy, and living in crowded environments. Treatment typically involves antibiotic ointments or oral antibiotics to clear the infection and reduce the spread to others.",

    "athlete's-foot": "Athlete's foot, also known as tinea pedis, is a common fungal infection of the skin on the feet, particularly between the toes. It can cause itching, stinging, and burning, as well as peeling, cracking, and scaling of the skin. Athlete's foot is most common between your toes, but it can also affect the tops of your feet, the soles of your feet and your heels. Your skin may become scaly and cracked or develop blisters. Sometimes, your feet smell bad. Athlete's foot is caused by various types of fungi, including Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum, that thrive in warm, moist environments like locker rooms, swimming pools, and shoes. Risk factors for athlete's foot include wearing tight, closed-toe shoes, sharing towels, socks, or shoes with an infected person, walking barefoot in public places, and having sweaty feet. Athlete's foot can spread to other parts of the body, such as the hands, if left untreated. Treatment typically involves antifungal creams or sprays to clear the infection and prevent recurrence. Keeping the feet clean and dry, wearing breathable shoes and socks, and avoiding walking barefoot in public areas can help prevent athlete's foot.",

    "nail-fungus": "Nail fungus, also known as onychomycosis, is a common fungal infection of the nails that can cause discoloration, thickening, and crumbling of the nails. It most commonly affects the toenails, but can also occur in the fingernails. Symptoms of nail fungus include yellow or white discoloration of the nail, thickening or crumbling of the nail, distorted shape or texture of the nail, cracking and breaking, separation from the nail bed, pain or discomfort in the affected nail, and a bad smell. It can affect several nails at once. Nail fungus is caused by various types of fungi, including dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds, that thrive in warm, moist environments like shoes and socks. Risk factors for nail fungus include aging, diabetes, weakened immune system, athlete's foot, hyperhidrosis, psoriasis, poor circulation, nail trauma, and exposure to warm, moist environments. Nail fungus can be difficult to treat and may require long-term antifungal medications or topical treatments. In severe cases, surgical removal of the nail may be necessary. Preventing nail fungus involves keeping the nails clean and dry, wearing breathable shoes and socks, and avoiding walking barefoot in public areas.",

    "ringworm": "Ringworm, also known as tinea corporis, is a common fungal infection of the skin that causes a red, circular rash with a raised, scaly border and a clearer skin in the center. It can occur on any part of the body, including the face, arms, legs, and trunk. Ringworm is not caused by a worm, but by various types of fungi, including Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton, that thrive in warm, moist environments. Symptoms of ringworm include a red (or brown), circular rash with a raised, scaly border, itching, and burning. The rash may be more prominent on the edges and less so in the center, giving it a ring-like appearance. Ringworm is highly contagious and can be spread through direct contact with an infected person or animal, as well as contaminated objects like towels, clothing, and sports equipment. Risk factors for ringworm include close contact with infected individuals, sharing personal items, warm and humid weather, and compromised immune system. Treatment typically involves antifungal creams or oral medications to clear the infection and prevent recurrence. Keeping the affected area clean and dry, avoiding sharing personal items, and wearing loose-fitting clothing can help prevent ringworm. Ringworm infections include: Athlete's foot: Also called tinea pedis, this fungal infection causes an itchy, burning skin rash between your toes and on the soles of your feet. Your skin may become scaly and cracked or develop blisters. Sometimes, your feet smell bad. Jock itch: tinea cruris, or jock itch, causes a red, itchy rash in your groin, upper thighs or rectum. Some people get blisters. Scalp ringworm (tinea capitis): this causes scaly, red, itchy bald spots on your scalp. If left untreated, the bald spots can grow bigger and become permanent. Hands (tinea manuum): signs of ringworm on your hands include dry, cracked palms and ring-like patches. Beard (tinea barbae): ringworm appears on your neck, chin and cheeks. The patches might become crusted over or filled with pus. Toenails or fingernails (tinea unguium or onychomycosis): nails become thick, discolored and deformed.",

    "cutaneous-larva-migrans": "Cutaneous larva migrans, also known as creeping eruption, is a parasitic skin infection caused by hookworm larvae that burrow into the skin and create red, itchy, winding tracks. It most commonly affects the feet, buttocks, and legs, but can occur anywhere on the body. A non-specific eruption occurs at the site of penetration of the hookworm larvae. There may be a tingling or prickling sensation within 30 minutes of the larvae penetrating. The larvae can then either lie dormant for weeks or months or immediately begin creeping activity that creates 2–3 mm-wide, snakelike tracks stretching 3–4 cm from the penetration site. These are slightly raised, flesh-coloured or pink and cause intense itching. Tracks advance a few millimetres to a few centimetres daily and if many larvae are involved a disorganised series of loops and tortuous tracks may form. Symptoms of cutaneous larva migrans include red, itchy, raised tracks on the skin, usually in a linear or serpentine pattern, swelling, and blistering. The condition is caused by hookworm larvae, primarily Ancylostoma braziliense and Ancylostoma caninum, found in the feces of infected animals like dogs and cats. Humans can become infected by walking barefoot on contaminated soil or sand. Risk factors for cutaneous larva migrans include living in or traveling to tropical or subtropical regions, walking barefoot on beaches, and having close contact with infected animals. Treatment typically involves antiparasitic medications to kill the larvae and relieve symptoms. Preventing cutaneous larva migrans involves avoiding walking barefoot in contaminated areas, wearing protective footwear, and practicing good hygiene.",

    "chickenpox": "Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious viral infection that causes an itchy, blister-like rash on the skin. It is most common in children, but can also occur in adults who have not been vaccinated or previously had chickenpox. The three stages of chickenpox usually refer to the way the rash looks: stage 1 is a red and bumpy rash. This can last a few days. Stage 2 is a fluid-filled blistered rash. The blisters break open after about one to two days. Stage 3 is when the blisters scab over. This stage also lasts a few days. Even though the rash goes through three stages, you could have all types of bumps at the same time. This means some bumps can be forming while others are already breaking open. The entire rash can last up to about 10 days. The rash typically starts on the face, chest, and back, and then spreads to the rest of the body. Symptoms of chickenpox include red, itchy rash that starts as small, raised red spots and then develops into fluid-filled blisters, fever, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, and scabs after the blisters break. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is spread through respiratory droplets or direct contact with the fluid from the blisters of an infected person. Risk factors for chickenpox include being unvaccinated, having close contact with an infected person, and living in crowded environments. Complications of chickenpox can include bacterial skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis, and shingles. Treatment typically involves antiviral medications to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Preventing chickenpox involves vaccination with the varicella vaccine, which is recommended for children and adults who have not had chickenpox.",

    "basal-cell-carcinoma": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer and the most frequently occurring form of all cancers. BCC most often occurs when DNA damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning triggers changes in basal cells in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis), resulting in uncontrolled growth. BCCs can look like open sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, scars or growths with slightly elevated, rolled edges and/or a central indentation. At times, BCCs may ooze, crust, itch or bleed. The lesions commonly arise in sun-exposed areas of the body. In patients with darker skin, about half of BCCs are pigmented (meaning brown in color). It's important to note that BCCs can look quite different from one person to another. BCCs rarely spread beyond the original tumor site. But these lesions can grow and become disfiguring and dangerous. Untreated BCCs can become locally invasive, grow wide and deep into the skin and destroy skin, tissue and bone. The longer you wait to get treatment, the more likely it is that the BCC will recur, sometimes repeatedly. There are some highly unusual, aggressive cases when BCC spreads to other parts of the body. In even rarer instances, this type of BCC can become life-threatening.",

    "rosacea": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the face, causing redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, red, pus-filled bumps. These signs and symptoms may flare up for weeks to months and then go away for a while. Rosacea can be mistaken for acne, other skin problems or natural ruddiness. Rosacea can affect anyone, but is more likely to develop if you: have skin that burns easily in the sun, have a history of smoking, have a family member with rosacea, are between ages of 30 to 50. It often begins with a tendency to blush or flush more easily than other people. Symptoms include facial redness, burning sensation, eye problems, enlarged nose, swollen red bumps, visible blood vessels, visible veins, and in severe cases, thickened skin and eye problems. The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Triggers that can flare up rosacea include hot drinks, spicy foods, alcohol, temperature extremes, sunlight, stress, and certain cosmetics or medications. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms through topical or oral medications, laser therapy, and lifestyle modifications to avoid triggers.",

    "sycosis-barbae": "Sycosis barbae, also known as barber's itch, is a skin infection that occurs when hair follicles become inflamed or infected. It is most common on the face, especially in the beard area. Scyosis barbae is a severe, potentially scarring form of shaving-related folliculitis. The entire hair follicle is infected, resulting in large red pustules. Itching, burning, or tenderness in the affected area is common. These bumps could also look like they're white-filled bumps or they could be filled with pus (pustules). Sycosis barbae is caused by bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, that enter the skin through a cut, scrape, or insect bite. Preventing sycosis barbae involves avoiding shaving or waxing irritated skin, and practicing good hygiene.",

    "herpes": "Herpes simplex is a virus that causes skin infections. The infection lasts your lifetime, and it causes painful or itchy sores and blisters that come and go. Herpes simplex virus typically doesn't cause severe problems. But it can be dangerous in infants and people with weakened immune systems. Herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1, commonly known as oral herpes) tends to affect your mouth or face. It causes cold sores. HSV-1 spreads through contact with saliva (spit). Sometimes a herpes infection can affect other parts of your body, such as your eyes or other parts of your skin. Symptoms of oral herpes include: small, red bumps or white blisters, itching, burning, or tingling in the mouth or on the lips, pain or discomfort during eating or drinking, flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and swollen lymph nodes. Oral herpes can be spread through contact with saliva, such as kissing or sharing drinks or utensils. Herpes simplex symptoms start with an unbearable itch at the HSV-infected site and progress to clear fluid blistering that is inflamed and painful at the base of the swollen red rash of the cold sores. The symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to 1-2 weeks, passing on to others through direct contact. The clear-water blisters will burst, ooze, and bleed, eventually forming a scab as the wound heals. Herpes is a contagious disease that is not curable. Symptoms may come and go and have the potential to reappear. After the symptoms have subsided, the HSV virus remains embedded and hidden in the nerve ganglion area throughout the body, causing no symptoms until the body's immunity weakens; and herpes simplex symptoms will reoccur.",

    "actinic-comedones": "Actinic comedones, also known as solar comedones, are small, flesh-colored bumps that develop on sun-exposed skin. They are a type of non-inflammatory acne that is caused by sun damage. Actinic comedones are most common in older adults, but they can affect people of all ages. Symptoms of actinic comedones include small, flesh-colored bumps on sun-exposed skin, especially the face, neck, chest, and arms. Actinic comedones are caused by sun damage, which weakens the skin's ability to shed dead skin cells. Risk factors for actinic comedones include: prolonged sun exposure, tanning bed use, and having fair skin. Preventive measures include avoiding sun exposure, using broad-spectrum sunscreen, and wearing protective clothing. Treatment options include topical retinoids and other medications to reduce the appearance of comedones and improve skin texture.",

    "erythema-ab-igne": "Erythema ab igne is a skin condition characterized by a reticulated, erythematous, hyperpigmented, or telangiectatic rash that occurs after chronic exposure to heat or infrared radiation. Erythema ab igne is most common on the legs, but it can affect other areas of the body as well. Limited exposure to heat, insufficient to cause a direct burn, causes a mild and transient red rash resembling lacework or a fishing net. Prolonged and repeated exposure causes a marked redness and colouring of the skin (hyper- or hypo-pigmentation). The skin and underlying tissue may start to thin (atrophy) and rarely sores may develop. Some patients may complain of mild itchiness and a burning sensation. Preventing erythema ab igne involves avoiding chronic exposure to heat or infrared radiation, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding scratching or picking at the rash. Treatment involves discontinuing exposure to the heat source and using topical treatments, such as retinoids or corticosteroids, to improve skin appearance. In some cases, laser therapy may be used to reduce pigmentation.",

    "melanotic-macule": "A labial melanotic macule is a well-defined, oval, brown to black, flat patch on the central third of the lower lip. It is the name for a freckle arising on the lip. It is also sometimes called a labial lentigo and when multiple lesions are present, mucosal melanosis. It is caused by an increased concentration of melanin in the basal layer of the epidermis. These macules are benign and not associated with any systemic disease. They can be distinguished from malignant lesions by their uniform color and border. A labial melanotic macule is thought to be provoked by sun exposure, and it is more common in fair-skinned people. However it may also occur in dark-skinned individuals and, as described above, similar lesions can arise in sites that are never sun-exposed. Luckily, melanotic macules are harmless. Treatment is generally not necessary, but monitoring for any changes in size, shape, or color is recommended. If desired for cosmetic reasons, treatments such as laser therapy or cryotherapy may be considered.",

    "hidrocystoma": "Hidrocystomas, also known as cystadenomas, sudoriferous cysts, and Moll's gland cysts, are benign cystic tumors that are derived from either the eccrine or apocrine sweat gland. They tend to grow slowly and usually occur on the face or scalp, commonly affecting the eyelid. They affect both males and females, are more common in adults, and are usually asymptomatic. Furthermore, apocrine hidrocystomas are not affected by temperature whereas eccrine hidrocystomas can grow in size with heat exposure and grow smaller in cooler temperatures. On physical examination, apocrine hidrocystomas are usually solitary, dome-shaped papules or nodules that range from flesh-colored to gray or blue. They range from a few millimeters to 1.5 cm and may involve the eyelid margin. In contrast, eccrine hidrocystomas are bluish or translucent-appearing papules that are usually located on the medial or lateral aspect of the eyelid that can be either solitary or multiple. They do not involve the eyelid margin but may appear close to this margin. They range from 1 mm to 5 mm in size. Although hidrocystomas are benign lesions, a biopsy may be performed to make an accurate diagnosis to rule out other malignant tumors of the eye. They are usually harmless but can be cosmetically bothersome. Risk factors for hydrocystomas include: having a family history of the condition, having a history of skin damage, such as burns or rashes, and having acne-prone skin. Treatment is generally not necessary. Options for removal include simple excision, laser therapy, or electrosurgery, performed by a dermatologist or ophthalmologist",

    "skin-tags": "Skin tags, also known as acrochordons, are small, soft, flesh-colored growths that hang off the skin. hey commonly appear in areas where the skin folds, such as the neck, armpits, groin, and eyelids, but can occur anywhere on the body. Skin tags are usually harmless but can become irritated or painful if they rub against clothing or jewelry. They are most common in middle-aged and older adults and may be associated with obesity or diabetes. Symptoms of skin tags include small, soft, flesh-colored or slighty darker growths that hang off the skin, particularly on the neck, armpits, and groin, and irritation or pain if the skin tag rubs against clothing or jewelry. Skin tags are caused by friction or rubbing of the skin, which can cause the skin to fold over itself and form a tag. Risk factors for skin tags include: having a family history of the condition, being overweight or obese, and having diabetes. Treatment is generally not necessary, but options for removal include cryotherapy, laser therapy, and electrosurgery.",

    "perleche": "Angular cheilitis, also known as perleche, is a common inflammatory condition that affects the corners of the mouth. It is characterized by redness, cracking, and soreness at the corners of the mouth, which can be painful and may bleed. Depending on the underlying cause, it may last a few days or persist indefinitely. Angular cheilitis is caused by a combination of factors, including infection with Candida, a type of yeast that is normally present in the mouth, and irritation from saliva, food, or other substances. Angular cheilitis may result in the following symptoms and signs at the corners of the mouth: painful cracks/fissures worse on mouth opening, blisters, erosions, oozing, crusting, redness (or pallor/darkening of the skin in some cases), bleeding. It is usually bilateral and symmetrical, however, it can occur on one side. It may progress to more widespread impetigo or candidiasis (oral thrush) on the adjacent skin and elsewhere. Risk factors include: dry chapped lips of any cause, oral thrush — this is more likely to occur in infancy, old age, diabetics, concurrent corticosteroid use or antibiotic use, and immunocompromised patients, dentures (especially if ill-fitted and there is associated gum recession), poor nutrition — coeliac disease, iron deficiency, riboflavin deficiency, general protein deficiency, zinc deficiency, vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency, systemic illness, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease) and Sjogren syndrome, sensitive skin, especially atopic dermatitis, genetic predisposition — eg, in Down syndrome, oral retinoid medication — can cause dry lips, eg, isotretinoin, acitretin, rapid weight loss — leads to reduced skin turgor/elasticity and increased skin folds, smoking — reduces skin turgor/elasticity, retrognathia (abnormal posterior/set-back position of the jaw), an overhang of the upper lip resulting in deep furrows (marionette lines). It is made worse by licking the lips. In many cases, no treatment is needed and angular cheilitis resolves by itself. General measures inlcude: improved general hydration, use of lip balm or a thick emollient ointment applied frequently (often sufficient treatment alone for saliva-induced angular cheilitis), topical antiseptics. Treatment includes antifungal medications to reduce the growth of Candida and relieve symptoms. Preventing angular cheilitis involves practicing good oral hygiene, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and managing underlying health conditions.",

    "tinea-beard": "Tinea barbae is a rare fungal infection that affects your skin, hair and hair follicles in the beard and mustache area. Tinea is the medical term for ringworm. Barbae is the Latin word for beard. The condition also goes by beard ringworm or barber's itch because barbers once spread the infection by using the same contaminated razors on different customers. It is caused by dermatophytes, a type of fungi that thrive on keratin found in the outer layer of the skin. Tinea barbae is contagious. However, it's rare for this fungal infection to spread from person to person or from contact with a contaminated object like a towel. You're more likely to get the fungus from an infected animal. Tinea barbae causes red, ring-shaped rashes on the outer layer of your skin (epidermis). These patches may have a raised border and can sometimes form ring-like patterns. The rash may be itchy, but it isn't painful. This rash may appear on the: cheeks, chin, neck, and upper lip (moustache area). The rash may also cause your hair to break off or fall out. Tinea barbae can cause a secondary bacterial infection. This can make the rash painful and cause it to ooze pus. Risk factors include: being a teen or an adult male working with farm animals, having autoimmune diseases, having diabetes, skin trauma due to scratcher or razor blades. Treatment includes antifungal medication and topical to reduce the growth of dermatophytes and relieve symptoms. Preventing tinea barbae involves practicing good skin hygiene, avoiding sharing grooming tools, and using antifungal medicine on infected animals.",

    "spider-angioma": "Spider angioma, also known as spider nevus or spider telangiectasia, is a common skin condition characterized by the appearance of a central red spot surrounded by smaller, reddish extensions that resemble spider legs. Spider angiomas are caused by the dilation of small blood vessels near the surface of the skin and are most common on the face, neck, chest, and arms. Spider angiomas are usually harmless but can be associated with liver disease or hormonal changes. Spider angiomas are marks on your skin caused by enlarged blood vessels. Symptoms of a spider angioma include: flat or slightly raised red to purple dot on your skin that's similar to a small pimple, dot has red to purple lines extending from the center (that resemble spider legs), dot is less than 1/4-inch in diameter (1/2 centimeter), the entire mark disappears when you press your finger on the spot, and then reappears when you move your finger off of your skin. Spider angiomas don't cause pain and may lightly bleed if they're injured. They are most common on arms, face, fingers, legs, neck, and torso, but can appear anywhere on the body. Spider angiomas are caused by the dilation of small blood vessels near the surface of the skin, which can be triggered by liver disease, hormonal changes, or other factors. Risk factors for spider angioma include: having liver disease, having hormonal changes, and being a child. Spider angiomas are usually harmless, but if you have multiple (more than three) marks on your skin, it could be a sign of another condition like: alcoholic hepatitis, liver disease, cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, thyrotoxicosis. If you have multiple spider angiomas, visit your healthcare provider for an examination. Spider angiomas don't need treatment because most angiomas go away over time. Children and young adults often grow out of spider angiomas, which disappear as they age. If you have angiomas because you're pregnant, once you give birth, your angiomas will go away after a few months. Some people choose to have angiomas removed for cosmetic reasons if they don't like how angiomas look on their skin. Your healthcare provider can remove angiomas by: performing laser therapy, where a powerful beam of light targets problematic blood vessels, using an electric needle (electrodesiccation) to burn off the angioma.",

    "venous-lake": "Venous lakes are benign, soft, compressible (squashable), dark blue to purple papules that are 0.2–1 cm in diameter. They can develop anywhere but most venous lakes are diagnosed on the lower lip (on the vermilion margin or mucosal surface), on an earlobe, or elsewhere on the face, neck, or upper trunk. They are caused by the dilation of small veins near the surface of the skin and are more common in older adults. Venous lakes are usually harmless but can be associated with sun damage or other skin conditions. Symptoms of venous lakes include small, dark blue to purple papules on the lips, ears, or face, and a soft, compressible texture to the papules. Venous lakes are caused by the dilation of small veins near the surface of the skin, which can be triggered by sun exposure, aging, or other factors. Risk factor includes being older adult. A venous lake is harmless and does not require treatment. A lesion that is unsightly can be removed by destroying the lesion. This causes a temporary scab, and the procedure may result in a scar. Treatments to remove a venous lake include: cryotherapy, electrocautery, sclerotherapy, intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy, vascular laser."
